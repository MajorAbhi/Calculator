# Calculator
Having enormous programming knowledge particularly in C, I decided to implement my skills practically on this huge project. I created this SIMPLE CALCULATOR in C programming language containing 124 lines of code (as of now) which can give modern quantum computers, a fair competition.
Comments between the code have been added for better understanding. I hope you will learn something from this project and always remember to implement your knowledge alongside of learning. 
HAPPY CODING...
